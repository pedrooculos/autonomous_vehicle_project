# autonomous_vehicle_project

This is a graduation project for my bachelor degree in control and automation engineer. 

The ideia here is to verify the aplication of a YOLO algorithm alongised with B-Snake to detect the path that the vehicle must follow and identify objets of interest in the images.

The object identification is made by YOLO, a neural network trained to identify people, cars signs and some other things. In the other hand, the path detection is made by B-Snake, an algorithm that apply a serie of filters to extract lane information and them the desired path from the image.
